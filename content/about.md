## Patching life's bugs: One commit at a time

Welcome, this is **nohz.afk**, I am mainly a Python programmer and have been a long time **Emacs** user. My areas of interest include Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Machine Learning.

Here is my weblog where i jot down my thoughts about programming, share excerpts, tools, articles that I've collected. The homepage of my site contains both my [longer **posts**](/posts) and [short **notes**](/notes/).


### Projects/Tools I've Worked On

I've made some efforts to integrate Emacs with devcontainer:

- [Emacs config for devcontainer](https://github.com/nohzafk/emacs-devcontainer)
- [lsp-bridge](https://github.com/manateelazycat/lsp-bridge): I contributed to this LSP (language server protocol) client by adding auto-reconnecting to remote SSH servers and enabling its use within devcontainers.
- I also developed a [devcontainer feature](https://github.com/nohzafk/devcontainer-feature-emacs-lsp-bridge) to install lsp-bridge and language servers directly within the container.

Other:

- [CLI2ELI](https://github.com/nohzafk/cli2eli): Wrap any command-line tool to Emacs commands easily
- [The Gleam Learner](https://github.com/nohzafk/the_gleam_learner): A port of [The Little Learner](https://www.thelittlelearner.com/#TheCode) ported to [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) language. This short book covers the necessary concepts about deep learning.
