### _Patching life's bugs: One commit at a time_

Welcome, this is **nohz.afk**, I am mainly a Python programmer and have been a long time **Emacs** user. My areas of interest include Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Machine Learning.

Here is my weblog where i jot down my thoughts about programming, share excerpts, tools, articles that I've collected. The homepage of my site contains both my [longer **posts**](/posts) and [short **notes**](/notes/).

This website is the first site that i ever build from scratch using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I put my emphasis on optimizing content readability and add my design flavor.
