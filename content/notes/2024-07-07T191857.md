I use a cron job to sync my [[Obsidian]] notes to a private GitHub repository every day. It's just a simple script to do a `git commit && git push`, and it works mostly fine. However, the `.github` directory synced to **iCloud** significantly slows down the Obsidian startup speed on mobile.

I just discovered [icloud-nosync]([GitHub - nicolodiamante/icloud-nosync: Take control of your iCloud Drive files with iCloud NoSync—the ultimate utility for effortless sync and management! Get the edge you need to stay organised and up–to–date.](https://github.com/nicolodiamante/icloud-nosync)), which can prevent the `.git` folder from syncing. The way it works is by replacing the actual folder with a symbolic link and renaming the folder with a `.tmp` extension, which prevents the folder from syncing to iCloud.
