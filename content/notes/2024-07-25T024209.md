after reading [When An Alias Should Actually Be An Abbr | sean henderson](https://www.sean.sh/log/when-an-alias-should-actually-be-an-abbr/) I completely abandon using **alias** in ==fish shell==, use **abbr** ever since.

**abbr** will expand the command into what it shorts for, before pressing enter to execute it.
For me the biggest advantage is that when searching the shell history there is ==no hidden complexity==, you don't have to member all the black magic that a short command name stands for.

> **abbr** is the new **alias**, **function** for everything else
