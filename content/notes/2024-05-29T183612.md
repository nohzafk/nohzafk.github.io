Posting a markdown document directly to Telegram will display formatting like code blocks and bold text in the message. However, the content received by the Telegram bot differs from what is initially sent, particularly with the removal of **backticks**.

To send the message content as **plain text** without formatting, I first paste it into Apple Note on iOS and then share it with the Telegram bot.
