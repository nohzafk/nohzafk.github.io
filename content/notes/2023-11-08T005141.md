I tried the command-line tool available at [GitHub - zurawiki/gptcommit: A git prepare-commit-msg hook for authoring commit messages with GPT-3.](https://github.com/zurawiki/gptcommit), which is designed to automatically generate git commit messages. While I haven't extensively tested it on significant code changes, the overall result is not too satisfying, but it is convenient to get something to start with.

OpenAI has introduced a new model `gpt-3.5-turbo-1106` recently, which has resulted in a price reduction for the gpt-3.5 API and an increase in the context window size from 4K to 16K.

setup with the following command:

```shell
gptcommit config set openai.model gpt-3.5-turbo-1106
```
