I'm quite fond of this sayingâ€”it captures the essence of Emacs perfectly.

> The core idea of Emacs is to have an expressive digital material and an open-ended, user-extensible set of commands that manipulate that material and can be quickly invoked.
Obviously, this model can be fruitfully applied to any digital material, not just plain text. {=[X](https://x.com/msimoni/status/1727669091870101549?s=46)}
