[RoutineHub • Elevate Mobile Coding Together with Apple Shortcuts](https://routinehub.co) amazing resources for iOS shortcuts, one thing particularly useful is that the website can `browse by App`. Those shortcuts that use [Scriptable on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188) and [a-Shell mini on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell-mini/id1543537943) Truly elevate automation capabilities on iOS to a new level. By combining these tools, you can accomplish complex tasks entirely on your iPhone.

`a-shell` notably supports `Python`, which is relevant given Python's ongoing discussions about adding Tier 3 support for the iOS platform in version 3.13. [PEP 730](https://peps.python.org/pep-0730/).

> The focus is on “embedded mode”, since there are no stdout on iOS and you can't provide things like the Python REPL {=[What's up Python? iOS support, ruff gets black, flask 3.0...](https://www.bitecode.dev/p/whats-up-python-ios-support-ruff)}
