When taking notes, friction is often a good thing. If it is too easy to create a new note, you don't write something on your own, but rather just collect information. Consequently, your brain do not process the information, so you learn less from just collecting and reading it. Physical notes have a physical constraint and a limitation on how much we can write on them, but digital notes have no such limitation and rely on self-discipline. So, when taking notes, it is too easy to write too many words. Keep it short and simple.
