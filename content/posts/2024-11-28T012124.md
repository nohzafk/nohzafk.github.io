[Auto-venv](https://github.com/nohzafk/auto-venv) is a Fish shell script that automatically activates and deactivates Python virtual environments when entering/leaving directory that contains virtual environment. 

Recently, I added multiple enhancements compare to the upstream version, now it handles edge cases more gracefully: 
- It safely manages virtual environment inheritance in new shell sessions.
- It prevents shell exits during the activation and deactivation processes.
