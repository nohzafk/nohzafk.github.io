# NotebookLM: A Helpful Tool for Passive Learning

In my opinion, Google's NotebookLM is a very useful tool. It's great at turning information from high-density format into low-density, easier-to-understand one, which helps with passive learning. Take podcasts, for example—while they don't pack as much information as books or articles, our brains are naturally tuned to language. By repeatedly listening to conversations from different angles, we can trigger new thoughts and slowly absorb knowledge.

Listening to podcasts while doing other activities, like commuting or exercising, allows the information to sink in more naturally. Engaging with the discussions, debates, and ideas in these podcasts can spark thinking, helping us learn without much effort.

Books and articles, on the other hand, are more dense and require more focus and time to fully understand. To digest complex ideas, you usually need to take notes or reflect deeply, which takes more mental energy.

Podcasts offer a way to learn that doesn't require as much effort. That's why I find NotebookLM helpful—it makes it even easier to engage with lower-density formats like podcasts.
