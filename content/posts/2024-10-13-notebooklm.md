# NotebookLM: A New Tool for Passive Learning

In my view, Google's NotebookLM is a highly useful tool. It excels at converting information from high-density formats into more digestible, lower-density ones, which supports passive learning. Take podcasts, for example—while they are a low-density medium in terms of information, our brains are naturally attuned to language. Through repeated exposure to conversations from different perspectives, we can spark ideas and gradually internalize knowledge.

Listening to podcasts while doing other tasks, such as commuting or exercising, allows the information to seep in more naturally. Engaging with the discussions, debates, and dialogues in these podcasts can stimulate thinking, enabling a form of passive learning. It's a process that happens without much conscious effort.

In contrast, books and articles are higher-density formats, requiring more focus and time to fully absorb. Complex concepts often necessitate note-taking and deep reflection to process, demanding more mental energy.

Podcasts, on the other hand, offer an alternative that doesn't require the same level of cognitive effort. That's why I find NotebookLM to be a helpful tool—it makes engaging with lower-density formats like podcasts even easier.
