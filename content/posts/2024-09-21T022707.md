title: Cheap and Capable `gpt40-mini` Boosts Input Quality
tags: [api, gpt40-mini, llm]

API price for `gpt40-mini` is very cheap yet the model is very capable, it is basically a nearly-free boost for the input quality for larger [[LLM]] models.

Here is a prompt I used

```quote
Enhance the following text to improve its quality for processing by a larger language model:

1. Correct any grammatical or spelling errors.
2. Improve sentence structure and flow.
3. Clarify any ambiguous or vague statements.
4. Ensure logical coherence and progression of ideas.
5. Remove redundant information while preserving all key points.
6. Maintain the original tone and intent of the text.
7. Do not add new information or alter the core meaning.

Provide the enhanced text in a clear, concise format. If any part of the text is unclear or requires subject matter expertise to interpret, flag it with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] at the end of the relevant sentence.
