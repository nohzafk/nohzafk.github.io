# LLM Sampling Techniques: Minimum Probability and Temperature

## Minimum Probability Sampling

### Definition
Minimum probability sampling is a technique used in language model APIs to balance between diversity and coherence in the model's output.

### How it works
- Sets a dynamic threshold for token selection based on the probability of the most likely token.
- The threshold is a fraction (determined by the **min_p** value) of the top token's probability.

#### Example explanation
   Let's say min_p = 0.1, and we're generating the next token:

   Scenario A:
   - Most likely token probability: 95%
   - Threshold: 95% * 0.1 = 9.5%
   - Only tokens with probabilities ≥ 9.5% are considered

   Scenario B:
   - Most likely token probability: 10%
   - Threshold: 10% * 0.1 = 1%
   - Tokens with probabilities ≥ 1% are considered

#### Adaptive nature
   - When the model is very confident (high top probability), the threshold is higher, limiting options to maintain coherence.
   - When the model is less certain (lower top probability), the threshold lowers, allowing more diverse options.
### Benefits
- Preserves diversity for open-ended choices
- Maintains coherence for deterministic choices (e.g., programming syntax)
- Allows higher temperatures without losing coherence

## Temperature in LLM Sampling

### Definition
Temperature controls the randomness in token selection during text generation.

### Effects of Higher Temperature
1. Increased diversity in outputs
2. Exploration of less likely options
3. Reduced repetitiveness
4. Better performance on open-ended tasks
5. Potential mitigation of model biases
6. Improved resilience to prompt engineering

### Challenges
- Maintaining coherence and relevance at higher temperatures

### Optimal Use
- Lower temperatures: Tasks requiring high accuracy or factual correctness
- Higher temperatures: Creative or exploratory tasks

## Synergy: min_p and Temperature

Combining min_p sampling with higher temperatures allows for:
- Increased creativity and diversity in outputs
- Maintained coherence by filtering out extremely improbable tokens

## Key Takeaways

1. min_p sampling adapts token selection threshold based on the model's confidence.
2. Higher temperatures increase output diversity but risk coherence.
3. Combining min_p with higher temperatures balances creativity and coherence.
4. The optimal sampling strategy depends on the specific task and desired outcome.
