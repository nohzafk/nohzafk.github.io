# Note
Note format is important, use proper template to provide insights.

Write learning note using your own words, for the mind to digest material.!

DO NOT copy and paste, otherwise you are not learning and thinking, only collecting information.

Adopt **atomic note** philosophy. When discussing a new concept, create new note and link back to it. Do not write it inside the note **concept**, in order to form a network of ideas, instead of a few big notes.

Give context when discussing information, either by using embedded text or adding callout.

# Tag and Link
Use tag only as is-a relationship, exercise restraint when tagging.

Use tag can will be reused, not too vague, not too specific.

Use nested tags as a virtual file system

Use link for connecting, it is OK to use HighOrderNote which is just empty note for connecting notes.

# General suggestions
Do not edit notes in a Wikipedia style, it loses all the points that matter.

Note taking is different from information collection, distinguish between these two, do not only do information collection. proper **2024-06-10-friction-is-a-good-thing|friction is a good thing**
