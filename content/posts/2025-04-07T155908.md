title: Authentication and Permission Logic in Django Rest Framework ViewSets
tags: [django]
---
In django rest framework, a ViewSet class can have  an authentication_classes with multiple authentication backend and a permission_classes with multiple permission backends.

For the authentication backends, it is a **OR** relation, meaning one authentication backend returns **None**, the framework will try next backend.

But for permission backends, it is a **AND** relation, meaning all permission backends must return **True** to indicate that the request passes the permission check. It is a common mistake to assume that permission_classes behave like authentication_classes.
