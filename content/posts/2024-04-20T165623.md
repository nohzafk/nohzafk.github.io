[Edward Gibson: Human Language, Psycholinguistics, Syntax, Grammar & LLMs | Lex Fridman Podcast #426 - YouTube](https://youtu.be/F3Jd9GI6XqE)

I learned that surprisingly, the brain areas activated during language processing and coding are not the same, nor do they overlap. 

Additionally, human languages tend to minimize word dependency distance, which has provided me with valuable insight into the structure of the German language. In German, there’s a rule that places the verb at the end of a subordinate clause. 

Initially, this might seem odd, but it becomes logical from the perspective of minimizing word dependency distance. Consider the sentence: 

“Die neuen Richtlinien legen fest, dass die Projekte je nach ihrer ökologischen Bedeutung **eingestuft werden könnten**.”

In this example, the words in the latter part of the subordinate clause are closely positioned, making the sentence easier to process.
