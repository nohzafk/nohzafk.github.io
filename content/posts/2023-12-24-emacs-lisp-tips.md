## built-in **use-package**
As a seasoned Emacs user, I've been eagerly anticipating the built-in arrival of use-package in version 29.1. And now it's finally here! This [declarative configuration tool](https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/spotlight-use-package-a-declarative-configuration-tool) has already become my go-to for confining all the chaotic Emacs configurations, making everything more organized and manageable. So, if you haven't already, I'd wholeheartedly recommend upgrading your Emacs to the latest version 29.1.

## Tips for Checking Package Installation 

When you're neck-deep in code, it's quite common to forget whether you've installed a particular package or not. Emacs has got you covered with several commands: 

- **featurep**: Use this if a package ends with provide. 
- **fboundp**: This comes in handy when you need to check if a certain function is defined. 
- **bound-and-true-p**: Use this to confirm whether a global minor mode is both installed and activated.

## The Power of cl-letf 

I've found [**cl-letf**](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/cl.html#Macros) to be incredibly useful when I need to dynamically and temporarily override functions and values defined externally. It's particularly handy when paired with advice, allowing me to alter the behavior of third-party packages without meddling with their source code.

Here's a practical example of how to override a function defined in a package. The code modifies the behavior of original-split-window-horizontally inside create-window so that no matter what argument it receives, a fixed width is used:

```elisp 
(defun my-create-window-advice (orig-fun &rest args)
  "Advice to modify the behavior of `split-window-horizontally' in `create-window'."
  (let ((original-split-window-horizontally (symbol-function 'split-window-horizontally))
        (fixed-width 20)))
    (cl-letf (((symbol-function 'split-window-horizontally)
               (lambda (&optional size)
                 (funcall original-split-window-horizontally fixed-width))))
      (apply orig-fun args))))

(advice-add 'create-window :around #'my-create-window-advice)
```

## Embracing thread-first and thread-last Macros

One of my favorite features of Emacs version 25 and onwards is the built-in thread-first and thread-last macros. These can prove immensely useful when dealing with complex data transformations - they help maintain clean and readable code.

In Emacs Lisp, the thread-first (`->`) and thread-last (`->>`) macros are powerful tools for improving the readability of function call sequences. They allow for a more intuitive and linear style of writing nested function calls, especially useful in situations where you have multiple operations that need to be applied in sequence.

## Summary 

After a decade of using Emacs, it continues to be an indispensable part of my programming arsenal. Once one has really recognized the extensibility of emacs, itâ€™s hard to not miss it every time using another editor.
