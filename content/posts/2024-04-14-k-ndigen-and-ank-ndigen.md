# kündigen and ankündigen 

kündigen: to terminate, to quit 

ankündigen: to declare 

“Ankündigen” is a separable verb and consists of the prefix “an-” and the base verb “kündigen,” which on its own means “to terminate” or “to quit,” usually in the context of employment or contracts. The prefix “an-” changes the meaning of the base verb to imply the start or the announcement of something.

# how to understand the connection 

Understanding how the prefix "an-" alters the meaning of the base verb "kündigen" in German can indeed seem challenging, especially when the meanings of the prefix and base verb appear quite distinct. Here's a more intuitive way to comprehend this transformation:

## Linguistic Analysis

- Base Verb "kündigen": Originally means "to terminate" or "to give notice." This verb indicates ending something formally, such as a contract or employment.

- Prefix "an-": This prefix in German often signifies the beginning of an action or adds a sense of initiation to the base verb. It can also denote attachment or proximity.

## Conceptual Bridge

The key to understanding "ankündigen" lies in bridging the concepts of 'starting' and 'ending'. When you "kündigen" (terminate), you're essentially bringing something to an end. However, **many endings naturally lead to new beginnings**. Adding "an-" to "kündigen" shifts the focus from the end of one phase to the initiation of another. In essence, "ankündigen" involves initiating the process of making others aware of a new beginning or change. It's about declaring the start of something new that follows the end of something old.

## Example in Context

Consider a situation where a company decides to terminate a product line ("kündigen"). The announcement of this decision ("ankündigen") marks the beginning of a new phase for the company, such as the introduction of a new product line or strategy. Here, "ankündigen" does not just communicate the termination but also sets the stage for what is to come next.

## Memory Tips

- Visualize a Door: Imagine closing one door ("kündigen") and immediately turning to open another ("ankündigen"). The act of announcing is like opening that new door.

- Think of a Sequel: When a film ends, the announcement of a sequel is akin to "ankündigen." It signals the start of a new narrative following the conclusion of the previous one.

By visualizing the transition from ending to beginning and understanding "an-" as a marker of initiation, "ankündigen" can be seen as a natural and intuitive extension of "kündigen." This conceptual connection helps grasp the transformation effected by the prefix and aids in memorizing the usage of these verbs in German.
