Just learned that using [[Emacs]], press {#C-\\} to set input method to **TeX**, then input Greek symbols will be very easy, for example type `\theta` will display θ

Here are some frequently used symbols when writing math equations. 

|            | symbol |
| ---------- | ------ |
| \alpha     | α      |
| \theta     | θ      |
| \delta<br> | Δ      |
| \nabla     | ∇      |
