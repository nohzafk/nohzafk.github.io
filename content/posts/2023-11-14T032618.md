In Emacs, the `fill-paragraph` function neatly reflows a block of text, wrapping lines to fit within a specified column width. VS Code offers an extension called "Rewrap," which you can install to enjoy similar functionality.

- Selecting the text you want to rewrap and pressing `Alt+Q`, or
- Placing your cursor within a comment block and pressing `Alt+Q` to rewrap that comment.

This feature can increase your productivity significantly if you're editing or writing a considerable amount of text. It streamlines the process of formatting paragraphs, ensuring that they look neat and are easier to read, very much like Emacs’ `fill-paragraph`.
