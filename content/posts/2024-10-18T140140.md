I wrote an LLM prompt generator/optimizer [ChatGPT - CO-STAR Prompt Optimizer](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-WOmqKbNKy-co-star-prompt-optimizer) base on [How I Won Singaporeâ€™s GPT-4 Prompt Engineering Competition | by Sheila Teo | Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-won-singapores-gpt-4-prompt-engineering-competition-34c195a93d41)

It use the CO-STAR technique:
- C: Context
- O: Object
- S: Style
- T: Tone
- A: Audience
- R: Response

and helps me to create relevant, creative, and precise responses that meet my needs most of the time.
